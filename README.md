# Pixel Char Maker

This is a pure Javascript + HTML website to create sprite characters. For instructions on how to use this program, access the page at https://gloamingcat.github.io/pixel-char-maker and read the instructions from there.

## How to Install

1) Clone or download the repository.
2) Start a local server. I recommend using the 'Live Server' plugin from VSCode.
3) Open the index.html file.

Note: for non-IT people, this program CANNOT be executed locally for security reasons. You need to start a local server. So if you want to make your own version of it, either learn how to do that OR re-upload the files somewhere.

## Future Features

* Export the configuration of the layers in a .json file.
* Make a decent mobile version.
